Arbitrage Route Creator

This repository contains a Python script named routecreate.py that generates combinations of exchange addresses and token addresses to find potential arbitrage opportunities in the DeFi space. It's written by Krazedegen.

Description

The routecreate.py script generates a list of combinations between exchange addresses, WFTM (Wrapped Fantom) address, and a list of token addresses. The output is then written to a JSON file, which can be further analyzed or used by other tools to find profitable trading opportunities.

Dependencies

Python 3.x
Usage

Clone this repository.
git clone https://github.com/Krazedegen/arbitrage-route-creator.git

Notes

Please note that the provided addresses and tokens are for the Fantom Opera network.
Make sure to update the exchanges, WFTM, and tokens lists with the appropriate addresses for your use case.
Arbitrage opportunities are subject to change, and the results generated by this script do not guarantee profits. Always perform additional analysis before executing any trades.
